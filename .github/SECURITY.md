# Security Policy

This section details instructions & information for those interested in learning
more about security concerns of using Jarvim. If there's a known security breach
with one or more dependencies (like third-party plugins) the project uses, you
can follow the instructions in this document to let the maintainers of the
project know about the same.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

Jarvim relies on many third-party plugins to provide an IDE-like experience in
Neovim. Keeping an eye out for security concerns for all these plugins isn't
possible. Hence, we rely on community feedback for the same. If you stumble
across any such loopholes, contact the maintainer through this email link:
