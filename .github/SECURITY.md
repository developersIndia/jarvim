# Security Policy

This section details instructions & information for those interested in
learning more about security concerns of using Jarvim. If there's a known
security breach with one or more dependencies (like third-party plugins) the
project uses, you can follow the instructions in this document to let the
maintainers of the project know about the same.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

Jarvim relies on many third-party plugins to provide an IDE-like experience in
Neovim. Keeping an eye out for security concerns for all these plugins isn't
possible. Hence, we rely on community feedback for the same. If you stumble
across any such loopholes, contact the maintainer through this email link:
